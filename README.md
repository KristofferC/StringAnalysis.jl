# StringAnalysis

This is a hard fork of the [TextAnalysis.jl](https://github.com/JuliaText/TextAnalysis.jl) package, designed to provide a simpler, faster and more orthogonal interface.

## Features
The aim is to make the **TextAnalysis.jl** code more powerful & simple. To keep track with the latest features, please consult [NEWS.md](https://github.com/zgornel/StringAnalysis.jl/blob/master/NEWS.md). At this point in development, [1] should still provide a rough guide on the library's capabilities. It may change in the future.


## License

The code has an MIT license and therefore it is free.


## Disclaimer

This is work in progress and bugs may still be present...¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ Do not worry, just open an issue or a pull request ;)


## Credits

This work would not have been possible without the efforts of the **TextAnalysis.jl** package developers.
