# StringAnalysis

This is a hard fork of the [TextAnalysis](https://github.com/JuliaText/TextAnalysis.jl) package, designed to provide a simpler, faster and more orthogonal interface for analyzing and working with strings and text documents.

## Differences with **TextAnalysis**
The aim is to make the code more more powerful & simple. To keep track with the latest features or changes, please consult [NEWS.md](https://github.com/zgornel/StringAnalysis.jl/blob/master/NEWS.md). This is work in progress and bugs may still be present...¯\\_(ツ)_/¯


## Introduction
At this point in development, [1] should provide a rough guide on the library's capabilities. While not a design aim in itself, the package tries to keep a similar API to **TextAnalysis**.


## License

This code has an MIT license and therefore it is free.


## Credits

This work would not have been possible without the efforts of the **TextAnalysis** package developers.
