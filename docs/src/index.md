# Introduction

StringAnalysis is a package for working with strings and text. It is a hard-fork from [TextAnalysis.jl](https://github.com/JuliaText/TextAnalysis.jl) designed to provide a more powerful, faster and orthogonal API.
**Note**: This documentation is still under construction and incomplete. For an overview of the basic capabilities of the package, consult the - still relevant - [TextAnalysis.jl documentation](http://juliatext.github.io/TextAnalysis.jl/).
